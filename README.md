# base-django

Base Django is a base application to build fastest django application.

Base provides a boilerplate to create Class Based Views and a set of useful models to use in a ready to go app.

We recommend use base with [Django CRUD generator](https://git.contraslash.com/ma0/django-crud-generator) 
(also mirrored on [github](https://github.com/contraslash/django-crud-generator)), to create CRUD segments in
  minutes.
  
We also provide an [authentication package](https://git.contraslash.com/ma0/authentication-django), (also mirrored in
[github](https://github.com/ma0c/authentication-django)) to speed up authentication
